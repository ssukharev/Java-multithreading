# Make your contribution!

In general, these works don't need to be better, BUT
any help is welcome and highly appreciated! 

If you want to contribute to the repository, the following instructions will help you get started...

## Development
### Necessary tools
- [Intelij Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
or 
- any other editor that supports Java app development
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting to work

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository is on your GitHub account and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) install it on your computer:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Java-multithreading.git
    cd Java-multithreading/
    ```
    
2. Add the remote `upstream`:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ssukharev/Java-multithreading
    ```
    
3. Create new branch with your name:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME main
   ```

4. Add completed work or other changes

    - Be sure to follow the [design guidelines](#contributing-code).
    - If you need to update your fork, you can do so by doing a `rebase` with `upstream`:
      ```bash
      git fetch upstream
      git rebase upstream/main
      git push origin BRANCH_NAME -f
      ```

### <a name="contributing-code"></a>Design recommendations
- All commits **must** follow the [naming convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Pull requests with commits that do not comply with this standard **will not** be accepted.
- Please make meaningful commit names or combine them (using `squash`) before opening the pool request.
  - Do not merge commits after someone has started checking your changes.
- Always use `rebase` for your commits to the current `main` branch. **Do not** use `merge main` in your branch.
- You are responsible for keeping your branch up to date. Your work **will not** be accepted unless it is migrated from the latest `main` branch.
- You can create a "draft" of the pull request in advance to get feedback on your work.
- Do not overload your work with unnecessary files that do not affect the understanding and performance of the completed task.
- To add comments to your work that you consider **important** for its completion, use README.md the files are in the root of their folder.
